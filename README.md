### Project Motivation:
This project is a part of my Udacity course in DataScience, and the dataset that I have chosen is also suggested by Udacity itself. This dataset is inspired by Robert, and really good to analyze and test variaty of skills in datascience. There are a few public datasets from Airbnb available, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what answers you are seeking to.

### Project Overview
The analyses is done on the Seattle Airbnb open data. 
The data set has 3 main datasets:
- 1.Calendar: Shows the availability of each listing throughout the year along with the listed price per night
- 2.Listings: Has all the listings along with the host and house details
- 3.Reviews: List the reviews each host has received for all their previous hosting

Â I have chosen the above data to answer the following three Business Question:-
Business questions answered from the analyses:
- 1.What are the neighborhoods most requested by Airbnb customers?
- 2.What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
- 3.How can you generate higher ratings?

### Installation:
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Conclusion:
In this article, we have analyzed some valuable information to know before making a booking through Airbnb in Seattle.
- 1. We have identified the most demanded neighborhoods by Airbnb customers in Seattle- Capitol Hill.
- 2. We then looked at the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle- the summer season.
- 3. Finally, we looked at the keys points to take into consideration in order to generate higher ratings- the behavior of the host.
- In my opinion, the above discussed are the key points to know before visiting Seattle.

I would like to thank Udacity for creating a platform to learn and upscale my datascience skills.
